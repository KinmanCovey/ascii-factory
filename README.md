ascii-factory
=============

ascii-factory is a Python program that takes an image file and converts it to ASCII art (as best as it can). Just a fun project that I wanted to try out. Will be returning to periodically as I can.

Usage
=====

Very simple. Enter a filename, then hit enter. Watch as it turns to ASCII art before you.
